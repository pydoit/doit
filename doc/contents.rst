`doit` documentation
====================

`doit` :ref:`documentation<main-doc-toc>` introduces the concepts of *every*
feature one by one with examples. It is the preferred way to learn `doit` and it
also serves as a complete reference. You may skip parts of advanced task
configuration used on non trivial work-flows on a first read, but make sure you
reach the docs describing the command line...

The total reading time for the whole documentation is about one hour.
