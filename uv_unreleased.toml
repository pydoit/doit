# Override uv sources to use local (unreleased) checkouts of dependencies.
# This file is NOT tracked in git.
#
# Usage: symlink as uv.toml so uv picks it up automatically:
#   ln -s uv_unreleased.toml uv.toml
#
# This avoids installing from PyPI and instead uses editable installs
# from sibling directories (equivalent to: pip install -e ../rut).
# Remove or adjust entries if you don't have the local checkouts.
